Messages to send: 
-when local table is updated let client know with this message: [Client table updated.]
-Must confirm if a message is received by the recipient with: [Message received by <receiver nickname>.]

-During dereg, if the server does not respond after retries + timeout, the following should be printed: [Server not responding] + [Exiting]
-Confirm when offline chat is saved by server: [Messages received by the server and saved]
-If a user logs in and has offline messages, must be sent: [You have messages]
